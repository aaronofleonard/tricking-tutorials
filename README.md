# Just the Skills Tricking Tutorials

Towards the end of 2018 the old tricking tutorial website Just the Skills is shutting down. I will no longer own the domain justtheskills.com or host the content.

These are the tutorials I wrote for that website, converted to Markdown format.

## What you can do with these tutorials

You can read them, copy the content, modify the content, fork the repository, send a pull request, put them on your own site, put them in a wiki, give me credit, not give me credit, upload new example images, etc etc. There is now no copyright on any of the content and I give permission for it to be used however.

Many have come forward and talked about the content to the old site. Some asked about asking to incorporate into their site, or host the content, or host the actual site. It was hard to choose just one "blessed" way to allow others to carry on the content. So, I'm just releasing it here for any one to do anything they want with.

My dream is for this content to be taken by active trickers (since I'm basically retired) and to continue shaping and evolving it to make it better for all.
